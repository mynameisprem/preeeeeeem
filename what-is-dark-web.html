     <h1 class="widw">WHAT IS DARK WEB?</h1>
     <p class="p1">The dark web is where people can buy illegal drugs and firearms. It's also dotted with sites that specialize in illicit pornography, including child pornography. It's a part of the internet that you can't find with traditional search engines such as Google. Because it is hidden, getting to the dark web isn't easy.When you access the dark web, you're not surfing the interconnected servers you regularly interact with. Instead, everything stays internal on the Tor network, which provides security and privacy to everyone equally. Worth noting: Dark web website addresses end with . onion instead of the surface web's .com, </p>
     <h2 class="dws" >-Is Dark Web Safe?</h2>
     <p class="p1">Accessing the content on the Dark web is relatively safe. Same as using a regular browser. Where the danger comes in is when you buy from illegal marketplaces or download files. While downloads may contain malware or keyloggers, the police can trace illegal purchases and get you in trouble.If the dark web page's scripts match surface web scripts, those using it could trace user activity. This is generally a problem for those using Tor browsers because they serve as a link between the dark and surface webs. If you choose to go on the dark web, there's a possibility that you will be tracked.In many ways, the risks of the 'Dark Web' are the same as those that may be encountered in the 'Open Web'. Young people in both environments may access pornography, indecent images of children, or sites selling drugs and weapons.</p>
